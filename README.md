# BoomBikes Case Study
> This project aims to identify variables and factors on which the usage of bike varies. The goal is identify the features/factors on which the bike usage depends and focus on that particular factors for increasing more demands for bike usage

## General Information
BoomBikes is a bike-sharing service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Currently this company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. Here we are trying to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bike depends. Essentially the company want to understand ---
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

so that the company can understand the problem and fixes required to gain the revenue.

Here we have the data of bike usage over the period of 2 years

## Conclusions
- The bike sharing system depends mainly on temperature.
- The negative coefficients implies that offers needs to be rollout to increase the demand.
